# MOD40 - Debugging and interacting with production applications

![Learning Path](https://img.shields.io/badge/Learning%20Path-MOD-fe5e00?logo=microsoft)  

## Session Abstract

Now that Tailwind Traders is running fully on Azure, the developers must find ways to debug and interact with the production applications with minimal impact and maximal efficiency. Azure comes with a full set of tools and utilities that can be used to manage and monitor your applications. In this session, see how streaming logs work to monitor the production application in real time. We also talk about deployment slots that enable easy A/B testing of new features and show how Snapshot Debugging can be used to live debug applications. From there, we explore how you can use other tools to manage your websites and containers live.
