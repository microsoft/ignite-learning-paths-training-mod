# Adding Cool Features to Your Application via Cloud Services (Previously APPS30)

Tailwind Traders has implemented development frameworks, deployment strategies, and server infrastructure for their apps. But now that they are on the cloud it’s time to extend functionality by tapping into powerful services that automatically scale and run exactly where and when they need them. This includes image resizing, messaging, integration with social media and tapping into cloud intelligence for image identification.

In this session, we’ll create a set of routines that run on Azure Functions, respond to events in Azure Event Grid, and integrate cloud services with Azure Logic Apps. We’ll also use Azure Cognitive Services to add AI capabilities and Xamarin for a mobile app.

## Demo Setup

The following steps are necessary to prepare for MOD30 demos.

### Software

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) LTS
2. Install [artillery](https://artillery.io/): `npm i -g artillery`
3. Install [Visual Studio 2019 Preview](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/?WT.mc_id=msignitethetour2019-github-mod30) with the Azure/cloud (for functions) and mobile workloads.
4. (Optional) Install [Storage Explorer](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/vs-azure-tools-storage-manage-with-storage-explorer?tabs=windows&WT.mc_id=msignitethetour2019-github-mod30)


### Deployments

1. Provision the Tailwind Traders monolith app available [here](https://gist.github.com/anthonychu/9ab34d2991fb5c1c0c29faeebbe43a51)
2. Deploy the MOD30 Assets: [![Deploy to Azure](https://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png)](https://azuredeploy.net/?repository=https://github.com/microsoft/ignite-learning-paths/tree/master/mod/mod30)
    > **Note:** give it a unique prefix it with, i.e. `mod30xyz` should replace `mod30`, and hereafter assume `mod30-demo` translates to `mod30xyz-demo`
3. Navigate to the `azureeventgrid` connection, click "Edit API connection" then click `Authorize` to authorize the connection (don't forget to `Save` after authorizing!)
4. Publish the `Mod30Functions` app to the deployed `mod30-app` endpoint.
5. Open the `socialintegration` Logic App and update:
    1. Search term (trigger)
    2. Owner name
    3. App name
    4. Token from App Center
6. Follow the steps in the [MOBILE-APP-README](./MOBILE-APP_README.md) for instructions on installing Xamarin and mobile application.

### Azure Portal

Create a custom dashboard for the session. (Tip: use `https:/aka.ms/publicportal` to ensure you are using the public portal.)

Pin the following items for easy reference:

* `mod30-demo` function app
* `mod30-demo` application insights
* `mod30demostorage` storage
* `mod30-app` function app
* `mod30-caption` logic app

## Demo: Serverless for Elastic Scale

1. Use the empty `mod30-demo` variant of the function
2. Create an In-portal HTTP Trigger (not the WebHook quick start, use "More templates...")
3. Mention function security types and choose anonymous
4. In another tab, open application insights (`-demo`) -> Live Metrics Stream (collapse outgoing requests and overall health)
5. Hit the endpoint either via Test or copy/paste URL in a new tab and show the live metric on Live Metrics Stream. Copy/paste method is preferred so you can capture the endpoint and use in the command line.
6. Point out the "servers" running.
7. Run `artillery quick --count 100 -n 100 {endpoint}`
8. Go back to Live Metrics Stream and show auto-scale working, response times, etc.

## Demo: Thumbnails with Functions

> **Important Note**: the demo as designed will only work with files using the `.jpg` (not `.jpeg`, `.png` etc.) extension. This should be handled by the app but in case you are testing it manually, keep this in mind.

1. Show the code for `MakeThumbnailHttp`
2. Take a picture in the app and save it
3. Navigate to the `wishlist` container in the storage account
4. Show the image and copy the full URL to the clipboard
5. Take a picture in the app and save it
6. Navigate to the `wishlist` container in the storage account
7. Show the image and save the full URL
8. Navigate to the `mod30-app` function and expand, drill into `MakeThumbnailHttp`
9. Open the "test" tab and change the body to:

    `{ "blob": "{url}" }`
10. Run and show the execution
11. Navigate back to the `wishlist` container in the storage account and show the thumbnail

## Demo: Trigger Function with Event Grid Event

1. Show the code for `MakeThumbnailEventGrid`.
2. Navigate to storage and show events blade. Mention the different ways to set up subscriptions.
3. Navigate to the `mod30-app` function and expand, drill into `MakeThumbnailEventGrid`
4. Click "Add event grid subscription" and add the details of the storage account
5. Give it a name like "WishlistSubscription"
6. Topic Type is `Storage Accounts`
6. Select the `mod30demostorage` storage account
7. Filter to just the `Blob Created` event
8. Wait for subscription to confirm.
9. Expand the function logs and keep those open.
10. Upload a new image and show it processed in the event grid
11. Navigate to storage and show the thumbnail.

As a bonus, you can show the "events" in storage to display the subscription and related metrics.

## Demo: Social Media Integration with Logic Apps

1. Navigate to the logic app and explain the steps. Point out how there is no code at all to authenticate with and/or search Twitter. It's just a simple step.
2. Do not expand the variables and reveal the token secret.
3. Open the HTTP post and show how it is possible to build URL, headers, and even payload
4. Tweet
5. Enable the logic app and run the trigger
6. Show the push notification

## Demo: Automatic Image Captioning with Cognitive Services

1. Navigate to the `mod30-caption` logic app
2. Open the Logic app designer
3. Walk through the various steps and explain how one step feeds into the next with variables
4. Expand the condition
5. Add a step to connect with the `UpdateDescription` function _after_ the `Describe Image Content` step.
6. Show the code for `Update Description` function.
7. Set the `blob` to the URL of the blob and `description` to the generated caption
8. Save, then enable the logic app
9. Upload a new image and show the automated caption

## Troubleshooting

If after the deployment, you navigate to `mod30-app` and there are no functions, you may need to manually deploy:

1. Under the function app, go to `Platform features`
2. Click `Deployment center`
3. Choose `External git` then click continue
4. Choose `Kudu` then click continue
5. Put in repo: https://github.com/Microsoft/Ignite-Learning-Paths and branch `master` and check `no` for `Private Repository`
6. Confirm and the deployment will begin. Once the status is `Success (Active)` you should have the function app
