# Train The Trainer - MOD30: Adding Cool Features to Your Application via Cloud Services

## Session Abstract

Tailwind Traders has implemented development frameworks, deployment strategies, and server infrastructure for their apps. But now that they are on the cloud it’s time to extend functionality by tapping into powerful services that automatically scale and run exactly where and when they need them. This includes image resizing, messaging, integration with social media and tapping into cloud intelligence for image identification.

In this session, we’ll create a set of routines that run on Azure Functions, respond to events in Azure Event Grid, and integrate cloud services with Azure Logic Apps. We’ll also use Azure Cognitive Services to add AI capabilities and Xamarin for a mobile app.
