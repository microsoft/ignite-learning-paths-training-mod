## V. Create a short link pointing to the website

Use your favorite link shortener to create a short link pointing to the Tailwind Traders website (Production slot). Later, we can use this to ask the audience to navigate to the site, and test the A/B testing slot.

## VI. Install different web browsers

To illustrate the A/B testing functionality, we'll need to open the same website in various web browsers, and we should get the new feature shown randomly. To do that, you'll need to have multiple web browsers. For more security and making sure that the new feature is shown, you should install 3 or 4 different browsers. For example, you can install [Edge Dev, Edge Canary, Edge Beta](https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com/en-us/download).

## VII. Time to rehearse your demos!!

Every time before you start the demos, you will need to execute a few simple steps to make sure that the environment is ready. [These steps are described here in details](./03-prep-demo.md). Have fun!!
