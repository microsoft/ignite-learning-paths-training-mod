# MOD10: Options for Building and Running Your App in the Cloud  

## Session Abstract

When Tailwind Traders acquired Northwind earlier this year, they decided to consolidate their on-premises applications with Tailwind Traders' current applications running on Azure. Their goal: vastly simplify the complexity that comes with an on-premises installation.

In this session, you'll examine how a cloud architecture frees you up to focus on your applications, instead of your infrastructure. Then, you'll see the options to "lift and shift" a web application to Azure, including: how to deploy, manage, monitor, and backup both a Node.js and .NET Core API, using Virtual Machines and Azure App Service.


The session [Ignite Learning Paths - MOD10](https://github.com/microsoft/ignite-learning-paths/tree/master/mod/mod10).
