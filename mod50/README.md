## Session Abstract

*In this talk, weâ€™ll take a deep dive into automating and continuously deploying your application using Azure Services. Weâ€™ll start with the basics, discussing automated operations that developers control (DevOps) like A/B testing and automated approval gates.*

*Weâ€™ll then take that entirely to the cloud using Azureâ€™s new DevOps project, showing you how you can automate the deployment of a frontend web application, backend web service and database, and mobile application with a few clicks of a button.*
