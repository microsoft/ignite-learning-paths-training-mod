# MOD50: Managing Delivery of Your App via DevOps

## Session Abstract

In this session, we’ll show you how Tailwind Traders’ Developer team works with its Operations teams to safely automate tedious, manual tasks with reliable scripted routines and prepared services. 

We’ll start with automating the building and deployment of a web application, backend web service and database with a few clicks. Then, we’ll add automated operations that developers control like A/B testing and automated approval gates. We’ll also discuss how Tailwind Traders can preserve their current investments in popular tools like Jenkins, while taking advantage of the best features of Azure DevOps.
