# MOD50: Managing Delivery of Your App via DevOps

## Session Abstract

In this session, weâ€™ll show you how Tailwind Tradersâ€™ Developer team works with its Operations teams to safely automate tedious, manual tasks with reliable scripted routines and prepared services. 

Weâ€™ll start with automating the building and deployment of a web application, backend web service and database with a few clicks. Then, weâ€™ll add automated operations that developers control like A/B testing and automated approval gates. Weâ€™ll also discuss how Tailwind Traders can preserve their current investments in popular tools like Jenkins, while taking advantage of the best features of Azure DevOps.
